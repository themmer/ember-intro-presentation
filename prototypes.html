      <h1>Tentative Outline</h1>
      <pre>
        ** Intro
          Programming for 16 years
          Worked in small, medium, and big companies
          Computer Science / MIS Majors
          MBA
          UX interest along with programming for 15 years
          Passionate about Ember.js (JS Framework)

        ** Current Problems with Requirements and Mockups
          Picture mockups usually go desktop first (and only desktop)
            Lacks conditions and interaction
            Theory vs Implementations
          Happy Path scenarios only
            What?! Ifs

        ** Creating Tech Websites / Apps
          Businesses
          	Prevent decisions that don't fit / make sense
          Entrepreneur
            Know the market and competition first
            Has time and money vs get the solution out there
          UX
            Simple HTML, CSS, and jQuery goes far
              Some of this can be reused/transitioned for real project

        ** Experience with High-Fidelity (HF)
          Hackathon
          Proof of Concepts at Work
          Side Projects
          Feedback from Developers

        ** Pain Points
        https://image.slidesharecdn.com/anintroductiontobdd-140422005433-phpapp02/95/an-introduction-to-behaviordriven-development-bdd-7-638.jpg?cb=1398128146
          Creating complete solutions multiple times
          Users discrepancy of need/want
          Users designing the end product
          Internal requirements without complete vision
          Lacking little material details on mockups

        ** Prototype
          Simulation or Sample of a product
          Test products
            Find problems (usability)
          Get feedback
          Ongoing process loop

        ** Low-Fidelity (LF)
          Relatively cheap and easy
          Limited function
          Limited interaction
          Great for high-level concepts

        ** Low-Fidelity (LF) - Examples
          User Flow
          Wireframe
          Sketches

        ** Low-Fidelity - Real Example

        ** High-Fidelity (HF)
          UX design is an iteration

        ** High-Fidelity (HF) - Real Example

        ** Why High-Fidelity (HF)?
          Realistic for users/customers/stakeholders
          Forces you to think
          Find problems earlier than real implementation
          Keep focus on user experience up-front

        ** Advantages of HF
          Page Hierarchy
          User Workflows
          Complex Components
          Interactive

        User / Stakeholder Benefits
          Person won't get hung up on incorrect or repeated data
          Less `squirrels` of what about this
          	'That's not the correct format of that data!'
          	'The data is repeating!'
          	'This button doesn't work!'
          See Responsive design and show data layout issues
          Some people need a visual to approve or find problems
          	If the stakeholder doesn't know this could guide them
        When stakeholders don't know what they want
          I've seen 3 iterations on projects before (server work included)
            Introduces bugs, frustrates most workers
        Can still be used with low-fidelity prototyping to start

        ** Disadvantages of HF with JS
          More expensive than low-fidelity if prototype is thrown away
          Requires specialized skills of UX design and/or programming
          Requires experience on the programming and design side
            Along with the frameworks and technologies chosen

          Takes longer than Low-Fidelity
            More expensive and/or time
            Entrepreneurship requires quick turnaround

          Simple tasks that add up
          	Troubleshooting
          	Routing
          	Data integration
          	CSS

          Spending time on server work
            Most likely requirements change
          	  Both client and server have to adapt
            Business logic

          YMMV
            Complexity of project / requirements
            Tech experience
            Designers
            TODOs

          Hurdles / Gotchas...

        ** My Hurdles of HF with JS

        Choosing technologies to achieve high-fidelity
          JS frameworks (Ember, React, Angular 2, etc)
          CSS/UI frameworks (Bootstrap, MDL, SASS, LESS, etc)
          Code formatting
        Coding first before document/design mockup
        Dev hat vs Design hat switching
        Smoke and mirrors <==> real?
        Data models and relationships
        Data integrity

        Wanting to do things the `right` way
          Login / Authentication / Session
          Hardcoding vs dynamic
          Fake data vs real data
          Data integrity between pages
          Spending time on code comments
          Unit Tests
          Data Modeling/Relationships (if not hardcoding)
          Code refactoring / Best practice
          Code reviews / TODOs

        ** Advantages of using Ember.js for HF Prototyping
          Automation of creation of files (CLI)
          Lots of available addons
            Creating a new project is easy
          Local data setup that can be switched to a server (ember-cli-mirage)
            `faker` creates random data and specific data rules (e.g. Length)
            Fake data can be used for testing too
          Auto Reload Browser with changes
          Out-of-the-box technologies already incorporated and ready to start
          Each project gets easier due to similarities and reuse

        ** Ember.js short video demo of using command line, page layout, and login

        ** Precautions of using JS Frameworks for HF prototyping
          Designers won't be able to do the heavy lifting
          Deliverable vs Research/Learning
          Focusing on final details instead of prototype

          Recommended experience:
            JS framework basic in and outs
            Programming experience
            UI components
            Javascript
            CSS / HTML

        ** Function vs Design First?
          With components and ui frameworks
            CSS is easier to change with SASS, LESS, etc
          Some design requirements is required
          	Quick sketch mockups
          	Navigation
          	Layout would be ideal on each page
          	Components - depends on the needs

        ** Google Ventures? (http://www.gv.com/sprint/)
             Design Sprint
        ** patternlab.io?
        ** Storybook React? (https://storybooks.js.org/)

        // Can cut out if no time
        ** Overall Process
          One thing at a time
          Goes in iterations
            Plan, Implement, Measure, Learn

        // Can cut this section out if no time
        ** Sx5 Rapid Prototyping for UX Design
          Strategy
          	What is the big goal of the product?
        	What does the user want?
        	What does the business want?

          Scope
        	Creating user stories (actions)
        	List objectives for the software
        	How does the product help the users?
        	How many clicks does it take to get to each essential function?
        	What type of user is interested in this application?

          Structure
        	How do all the pieces of the site fit together and behave?
        	How does the user find what they are looking for in an intuitive way?
        	What are the flow of actions and interactions throughout the site?
